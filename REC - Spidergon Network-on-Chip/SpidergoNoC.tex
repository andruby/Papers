\section{Introduction}\label{C:intro}
	
	A network-on-chip or NoC has become one of the key components in digital chips. As the number of components and transistors per chip grows continuously, most chips have become multi-core. These chips consist of a number of separate cores, often with fixed-function accelerators, memory arrays and input/output units.
		
	Historically buses or crossbar switches were used to connect the functional components of a chip. Above four cores, however, the limited bandwidth of a bus becomes a major limitation, and above 8 or 16 cores, crossbar switches become very expensive. Only a NoC provides the scalability needed for emerging multicore chips. The NoC bounds the performance potential of these chips and accounts for a substantial fraction of the power and area consumption.

\subsection{Technical Terms}\label{S:terms}
	This paper uses technical terms from the domain of computer networks. Some of them are explained here to help the reader.

\begin{description}

\item[System on Chip (SoC)] 
	refers to the integration of all components of a computer or electronic system into a single integrated circuit (chip).\cite{wikiSoC}
	
\item[An Interconnect Processing Unit (IPU)] 
	is essentially an on-chip communication network with hardware and software components which jointly implement key functions of different SoC programming models through a set of communication and synchronization primitives and provide low-level platform services to enable advanced features in modern heterogeneous applications on a single die.\cite{coppola2008design}

\item[A Chip multiprocessor (CMPs)] is a multi-core processor in which the distinct cores are integrated onto a single integrated circuit die.
