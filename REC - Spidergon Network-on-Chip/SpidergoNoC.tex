\section{Introduction}\label{C:intro}
	
A network-on-chip or NoC has become one of the key components in digital chips. 
As the number of components and transistors per chip grows continuously, most chips have become multi-core. 
These chips consist of a number of separate cores, often with fixed-function accelerators, memory arrays and input/output units.
		
Historically buses or crossbar switches were used to connect the functional components of a chip. 
Above four cores, however, the limited bandwidth of a bus becomes a major limitation, and above 8 or 16 cores, crossbar switches become very expensive. 
Only a NoC provides the scalability needed for emerging multicore chips. 
The NoC bounds the performance potential of these chips and accounts for a substantial fraction of the power and area consumption.

\subsection{Technical Terms}\label{S:terms}
	
This paper uses technical terms from the domain of computer networks. 
Some of them are explained here to help the reader.

\begin{description}

\item[System on Chip (SoC)] 
	
refers to the integration of all components of a computer or electronic system into a single integrated circuit (chip).\cite{wikiSoC}
	
\item[A Network on Chip (NoC)] 

is a packet-switched on-chip micronetwork. 
It is the natural evolution of traditional circuit-switched bus solutions. 
	
\item[An Interconnect Processing Unit (IPU)] 
	
is a configurable and extensible communication component that implements system services and core communication. 
It is essentially an on-chip communication network with hardware and software elements which jointly implement key functions of different SoC programming models through a set of communication and synchronization primitives and provide low-level platform services to enable advanced features in modern heterogeneous multi-core SoCs.\cite{coppola2008design}

\item[A Chip multiprocessor (CMPs)] 

is a multi-core processor in which the distinct cores are integrated onto a single integrated circuit die.

\subsection{Spidergon Topology}\label{S:topology}

The proprietary Spidergon topology provides an interesting price/performance trade-off for SoC devices. 
In the Spidergon topology, all of the IP blocks are arranged in a ring where each IP block is connected to its clockwise and its counter-clockwise neighbour and directly to its diagonal counterpart in the network. 
This allows the routing algorithm to minimise the number of nodes that a data packet has to traverse before reaching its destination. 
A particularly important advantage is that the functional diagram (shown below on the left of figure \ref{fig: topology} for a network of 16 nodes) corresponds to a simple planar implementation (shown on the right side of figure \ref{fig: topology}) in which the wiring only needs to cross itself at one point. This is a key benefit in delivering high price/performance. \cite{STMicroelectronics2005}
